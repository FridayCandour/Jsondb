# Jsondb database

A lightweight, easy to use , secured, encryptable and practically fast Json based database for nodejs and browser

not yet that scalable for very big apps
use at your risk!

# problems to solve

- you should try using Deno for more stability
- saving with relations works but cascade doesn't for now
- .getWhere() needs a faster algorithm
- support for browser via local storage
- ruminant data encryption
